= A True Front-End Page Builder = 

So far, there were no page builders in WordPress that worked right. They were bloated, slow, unstable, and made a mess of your content. Forge is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, while keeping your WordPress site healthy. The interface of our <a href="http://forgeplugin.com/?utm_source=repository&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=freeversion" rel="friend">drag and drop builder</a> is made to be efficient, and does not get in the way between you and your pages.
